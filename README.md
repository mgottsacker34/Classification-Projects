# Classification-Projects

This folder contains two projects done for CSCI 1070: Taming Big Data at Saint Louis University.

The "Personal Final Project" folder contains the source code for a sentiment analysis project in which I classified several lines of "unknown" text based on training data trained on several different books by several different authors.

The "Sentiment Analysis" folder contains the source code files for a sentiment analysis project in which I classified 3000 unknown tweets in a foreign language as positive or negative based on 30,000 tweets in each of those categories.  I achieved 73% accuracy, the highest in the class.
